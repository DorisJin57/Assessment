Rationale for Transition:
a.	a. Greater Customization and Control: Compared to WordPress, CodeIgniter offers greater source control because it is a flexible PHP framework. Because of this, websites may be more fully customized, making it possible to create special features and components that WordPress might not be able to support. 
b.	Enhanced Efficiency and Performance: The architecture of CodeIgniter may greatly improve the website's efficiency and performance. Compared to WordPress, it is made for better resource management and faster execution, which results in faster page loads and a more responsive user experience.
c.	Structured and Maintainable Code: CodeIgniter's MVC design encourages a neat, orderly source code structure. The codebase is easier to grow and maintain because to this separation of concerns. Conversely, when a website becomes more complicated, WordPress's design may become unwieldy due to the way that themes and plugins combine logic and display.
